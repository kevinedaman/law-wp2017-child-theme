# 2017 Child Theme

## Summary

This project is a child theme of the TwentySeventeen theme supplied with the Wordpress install.  It incorporates Bootstrap 4 and Woocommerce, as well as a static front page with dynamic content.

## Requirements

 - TwentySeveneen Wordpress Theme
 - Wordpress 4.7 or higher.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have the TwentySeventeen theme installed.
2. Download the zip file.
3. Install and activate theme in your Wordpress admin panel.

## Static Front Page
In order to get the static front page to work with this theme, you need to create a that is going to be your front page, and don't put any content on it.  In the Wordpress settings set your static front page to this page, and blog to another page (again, without content).

The 3 Sections of the front page can be added to as follows:
### About Section
Create a page called 'About' with your info and featured image, using the page template "About" with your home page as the parent page.  This will be pulled into the front page.

### Merchandise Section
Any merchandise that you create in this theme will show up on this section.  Version 1.0 was designed to work with a relatively small store.

### Shows
Shows are posts with the category name of "Shows".  They also need two custom fields, show_location and show_date.  The post title (this is where I put the date) shows up to the left, information for "show_location" is on the right, and the post content is what appears with the toggle.  Featured images do not work with this (Ver 1.0)
